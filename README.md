# AboutMe
This is a game to learn about me and ask me questions!
Todays learning was a great one :
we started with a revision with the codes of the other students, went through the diffuculties
- we revised how to convert string to number 
- we made a demo code
-we revised the array
-we learned about the nested loops 
- we took examples on it and how it functioned 
- The global scopes and local scopes along with some examples , usages
- we took a demo on pair programing, then during the lab we worked on it in pairs which is really useful as we can brainstorm together, help each other understand all the missing points, worked through a long code that we have worked on 2 classes in a row. 
we are developing a code, learning together, working as teams.
